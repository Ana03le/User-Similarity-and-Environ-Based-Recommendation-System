# User-Similarity-and-Environ-Based-Recommendation-System
Developed a system by retrieving userâ€™s profile data from Facebook APIs using Graph API and MeetUp API, which generates a list of recommendations for movies, music, and books.
1. This project facebook api for data extraction.

2. The problem is with security level of new version of facebook api.

3. That is why I have one by one extracted most similar movies , books , and music of user and his friendds.
   We have stored them in list so that its easy for you to check the extracted data.

4. As soon as you click get recommendations on the user interface, all the calculations will be performed and results will be displayed.
